    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Hidilyn Diaz's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1991</strong> - Born in Zamboanga City, Philippines</li>
      <li>
        <strong>2002</strong> - She joined her first-ever competition in weightlifting, in the 2002 Batang Pinoy games in Puerto Princesa.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2007</strong> - Diaz joined her first Southeast Asian games, clinching bronze in the 58-kg category.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2008</strong> - She followed in Solis’ footsteps(The Philippines’ sole Olympic weightlifter, who participated in the Seoul games in 1988 - also became an early mentor), heading to the 2008 Beijing Olympics as a wild card entry. As in the previous year’s SEA Games, she competed in the women’s 58kg class. She placed 11th out of 12 weightlifters - the start of a journey that would take her all the way to Tokyo 2020.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2012</strong> - In London 2012 Olympics, she struggled with three unsuccessful 118 kg clean and jerk attempts. Diaz ended with a DNF - “did not finish” - a result that only fueled her fire.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2016</strong> - Diaz made a mark in the Philippine sports history, giving her country with its second-ever silver medal (and first from a Filipina) in the global games. She surmounted heavy odds, beating two favored weightlifters: Chinese-Tapiei’s Hsu Shu-Ching and China’s Li Yajun.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2018</strong> - In the Asian Games in Jakarta, Hidilyn go on to deliver another gold for the Philippines, conquering the weightlifting women’s 53kg division. It was also the year that Diaz began to take a firmer hold on the reins of her career.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2019</strong> - A year before the Tokyo games were supposed to kick off, she clinched a silver in the 2019 Asian Championships, and, just before the year ended, delivered yet another gold in the SEA Games.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2020</strong> - Diaz found herself stuck in Malaysia when the global lockdowns hit. Team HD was supposed to do more intensive training in Taipei.But travel restrictions kept Diaz in Selangor, Malaysia, which would become her home for the next year. It was a difficult time for Hidilyn. But, like before, she buckled up, gritted her teeth, and focused on her goal. As restrictions eased and the Tokyo games were officially a go, Diaz flew to Tashkent, Uzbekistan for the Asian Weightlifting Championships - an event that, just by showing up, would officially qualify her for the Tokyo Olympics. And now, she’s in Tokyo, ready for the lift of a lifetime in the women's 55kg category, which will kick off on Monday night, August 26.
